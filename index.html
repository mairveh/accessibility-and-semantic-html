      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        Tim Berners Lee dreamt of a World Wide Web that would be free and
        accessible to everyone. Sadly, the modern web is littered with poorly
        designed websites and difficult to navigate code (for both developers
        and users). This often comes down to a lack of understanding around
        different user needs. Designing pages that are accessible for everyone
        shouldn't be too difficult. The developers at Tech Returners News have
        collated an 'easy wins' checklist for Web page accessibility. Keep this
        guide handy... When creating your own websites you can check these
        criteria off the list!
      </p>
      <h3>Accessibility Checks</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <em>Heading elements & Page Titles:</em> HTML heading elements have
          been used to represent page structure, supporting assistive
          technologies that allow page navigation from heading to heading.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>Re-size Text:</em> You can vary text size by using your browser's
          text resize settings (through Options or Preferences), text-only zoom,
          page zoom (which also zooms images, buttons etc) without incurring
          styling issues / text over-lapping or being cut off the page.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>Alternative text for images:</em> All images have been given
          appropriate alternative text.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>Link text:</em> All hyperlinks should make sense when read out of
          context, and hyperlinks are clearly presented in a different text
          style from normal body text. If a link opens in a new browser page, it
          has been labelled as doing so.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em> JavaScript independence:</em> Where JavaScript or other scripts
          are used for navigation or functionality, an alternative mechanism has
          been put in place in case your browser does not support these scripts.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>Colour contrast:</em> has been checked for text and background
          colour combinations to ensure that the contrast is sufficient and I
          have also ensured that information is not referenced by colour alone.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>Style sheets:</em> If style sheets are not supported or are turned
          off, information on the site can still be accessed and read.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>Forms:</em> forms are marked up correctly so people can interact
          with them using only the keyboard, voice input or screen readers. The
          form labels themselves are clickable, increasing the target area and
          making it easier to select small radio buttons of checkboxes.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>
        By spending just a little more time on getting the building blocks of
        the web right, developers can help create an Internet that works for
        everyone.
